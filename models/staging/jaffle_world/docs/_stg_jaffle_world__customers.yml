unit_tests:
  - name: test_is_valid_email_address
    model: stg_jaffle_world__customers
    description: >
      Check that is_valid_email logic captures of our known edge cases:
      - emails that have a .com without domain, like nodomain@.com
      - emails that have a truncated domain address, like truncated@domain.c
      - emails that have a missing dot in the domain, like missingdot@domaincom
      - emails with no @, like noat.com
      Additionally, we should check we're not marking emails which are valid 
      that contain special characters, such as:
      - c+berger@jaffle-shop.com
      - d.horner@jaffle.com
    given:
      - input: source('jaffle_world', 'customers')
        rows:
          - {email: nodomain@.com}
          - {email: Buffalo@domain.c}
          - {email: Axyotl@domaincom}
          - {email: Noatsymbol.com}
          - {email: gia+ntpanda@domain.com}
          - {email: empty.zoo@domain.com}
    expect:
